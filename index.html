            Usually we assign a team of at least two cleaners to each job. We try
            to allocate the same crew to a regular booking in order to ensure a
            consistent service. Our expert cleaners are carefully selected and
            screened and then fully trained to give them a deep understanding of
            products and procedures and help them provide top-quality services at
            all times. They are adept in cleaning various surfaces and all
            textiles, including even the most delicate fabrics. Our professionals
            will clean thoroughly and get rid of any dirt, dust, grime and stains.
            Our teams are equipped with high-end professional equipment provided
